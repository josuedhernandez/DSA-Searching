# DSA-Searching
Search Algorithms Practice
Also a UI in REACT was created to input values and evaluate searching algorithms.

# Assignment
1. Given a sorted list 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 and using the recursive binary search algorithm, identify the sequence of numbers that each recursive call will search to try and find 8.
   * 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18
   * 3, 5, 6, 8, 11
   * 8, 11
   * 8

2. Given a sorted list 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 and using the recursive binary search algorithm, identify the sequence of numbers that each recursive call will search to try and find 16.
   * 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18
   * 12, 14, 15, 17, 18
   * 17, 18
   * 18
   * return -1 can't find error.
4. Searching in a BST
** No coding is needed for these drills**. Once you have answered it, you can then code the tree and implement the traversal to see if your answer is correct.

    1) Given a binary search tree whose in-order and pre-order traversals are respectively 14 15 19 25 27 35 79 89 90 91 and 35 25 15 14 19 27 89 79 91 90. What would be its postorder traversal?

    2) The post order traversal of a binary search tree is 5 7 6 9 11 10 8. What is its pre-order traversal?
